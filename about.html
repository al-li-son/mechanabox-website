                            Hey! What's up guys, this is Allison Li from Mechanabox, formerly known as TheProgrammingCuber. I'm currently a
                            student at the Olin College of Engineering. My major is undecided at the moment, but my primary interests are in 
                            mechanical or robotics engineering. I've been a maker for as long as I can remember, always taking apart and putting 
                            back together whatever I could get my hands on. 
                            <br><br> I learned how to solve a Rubik's Cube in 2013 and have been an active member of the cubing community since
                            then. I've collected nearly 200 different puzzles and have competed in over 20 competitions. My official results
                            can be found <a href=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014LIAL01 target="_blank">here</a>. 
                            I started my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TheProgrammingCuber" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> as TheProgrammingCuber
                            in March of 2014 and uploaded consistently for several years before taking a break in the last few years to focus on 
                            school and my other activites. My videos primarily consisted of unboxings of puzzles, reviews, and competition vlogs. 
                            I also released several videos of my Rubik's cube modifications ("mods"), which has become my primary interest in cubing 
                            recently. My other primary project on YouTube is as a co-host of the Dlsone Podcast, a cubing podcast that I started 
                            with my friends <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DGCubes" target="_blank">DGCubes</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/HashtagCuber" target="_blank">Hashtag Cuber</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DerpyCuber" target="_blank">Derpy Cuber</a>, and
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TheRubiksCubed" target="_blank">TheRubiksCubed</a>, and recently brought on
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/JRCuber" target="_blank">JRCuber</a>.
                            <br><br> Outside of cubing, one of my main extracurriculars has been robotics. I was on VEX team 750R for two years, one of
                            six teams in my high school's club. I spent my first year as a co-captain of the team and the lead mechanical engineer, and we 
                            made the World Championships with a top 100 world skills ranking. My second year I remained the lead mechanical engineer but
                            stepped down from the captain position to become a co-president of the club, and throughout the year I worked with all six
                            teams and helped organize freshman tryouts and other events, including our home competition. I hope to take the experience I
                            gained through robotics to college and to continue to feed my engineering interest.
                            <br><br> Music has also played a large part in my life, as I have been playing clarinet since I was 9 years old. I was in 
                            school concert band from 4th grade through my senior year and spent all four years of high school in the marching band, which
                            won three state titles and four Yamaha cup titles in my time there. My junior year, our wind ensemble recorded an audition tape for 
                            the National Concert Band Festival, which we were subsequently accepted to and were set to perform at the event in Indianapolis in 
                            March of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled it.
